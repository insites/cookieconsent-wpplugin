Cookie Consent is designed to help you comply with the hideous EU Cookie Law and not make you want to kill yourself in the process. So we made it fast, free, and relatively painless.

The official Cookie Consent WordPress plugin has all the functionality [Cookie Consent configurator](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/download/ "Cookie Consent JS plugin page") on your own site's admin panel.
In addition to that you can use custom code, to access the full functionality of Cookie Consent.

2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` screen in WordPress.
3. Use the `Settings`->`Cookieconsent` to enable and configure the cookie consent popup.
